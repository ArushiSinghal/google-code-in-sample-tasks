# OpenWISP - Google Code-In Sample Tasks

## Re-design the OpenWISP website theme

Many years have passed since OpenWISP was introduced, it's time to refresh our brand identity and we need help.

We need an HTML5+CSS with the following features:

- responsive
- readable
- lightweight
- has a design for the homepage
- has a design for simple content pages
- has a landing page design that can be used to promote specific features or modules

We would like the design to convey our commitment to helping creating new networking infrastructure in emerging economies, giving warm and friendly feeling to each new visitor as well as to impress them with our features.

With your help and creativity we can attract younger generation to our community!

## Re-design the OpenWISP logo

Many years have passed since OpenWISP was introduced, it's time to refresh our brand identity and we need help.

The best option would be to have a logo that works well in the following forms:

- rectangular shape (like our actual logo)
- square

This way we can use it on webpages as well as stickers and t-shirts!

We don't need a totally new logo, we would like a small variation from the actual one, but we are open for creative proposals :-).

## Design an OpenWISP t-shirt

Design a T-shirt for OpenWISP users and developers.

The design should feature the OpenWISP logo and a tagline, you can use the front and the back too.

Be creative! Search the web for design inspiration before working on this, but you must submit a completely original design of your own creation that does not use 3rd party images from the web. If you create a design similar to something you found on the web, it is considered a derivative work and you should give proper attribution (i.e., credit) to that author by name with a link to their work. Failure to give credit is plagiarism and can be grounds for dismissal from GCI. When in doubt, design something unique. ;)

Submit a preview image of the t-shirt front and back in PNG format as well as your original artwork files ideally in vector format (e.g., PSD, XCF, SVG, AI, etc).

If you would like credit, please provide your name and join our mailing list to hear if we use your t-shirt design.

Be awesome, be creative, be inspired, be original. ;)

## [ansible-openwisp2] Automatically add the clearsessions command to crontab

The ansible role for openwisp2 (the official way to install OpenWISP 2) should automatically include the command
`./manage.py clearsessions` in a daily cronjob.

See also the [issue #24 in the ansible-openwisp2 repository](https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/issues/24).

## [ansible-openwisp2] Add a way to specify a different source for each openwisp2 module

In ansible role for openwisp2 (the official way to install OpenWISP 2), it would be very useful to add a way to specify a different branch or repository for each openwisp2 module installed via **pip** (the **python** package manager) in order to test new features that are being developed in separate branches or in other repositories.

See also the [issue #25 in the ansible-openwisp2 repository](https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/issues/25).

## OpenWISP templates repository on Github
A templates repository on github could be useful for common configurations like eduroam. 
A lot of different templates will be shared by/to the community. 
Then the template could be imported in OpenWISP advanced mode with a simple copy/paste.
